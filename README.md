# Afterwords — Give Claude Code a Voice

Give Claude Code a voice. Clone any voice from a 15-second YouTube clip, run it locally on your Mac, and hear Claude speak every response.

## Why

Claude Code has [`/voice`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/voice-dictation) — hold Space to dictate prompts. But it's input only. Claude can hear you; you can't hear Claude. This project adds the missing half: **text-to-speech output** via a local voice-cloning server. Together, `/voice` input + TTS output = full voice conversations with Claude Code.

No cloud API. No subscription. No data leaves your machine. The voice comes from a 15-second audio sample — yours, a friend's, or anyone on YouTube.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrianwedd/afterwords.git
cd afterwords
bash setup.sh
```

The setup script:
1. Checks prerequisites (Apple Silicon, 8 GB+ RAM, Python 3.11+)
2. Creates a Python venv and installs dependencies
3. Walks you through cloning a voice from a YouTube clip
4. Installs a Claude Code Stop hook that speaks every response
5. Sets up a launchd service so the server auto-starts on login

After setup, open Claude Code and try `/voice` — dictate a prompt, hear the response.

## Adding More Voices

```bash
bash clone-voice.sh
# or non-interactive:
bash clone-voice.sh "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." galadriel 30
```

The script downloads the audio, extracts a 15-second segment, denoises it, transcribes with Whisper, and saves a voice profile. Each voice is just a 700 KB WAV file — adding voices costs zero extra memory.

## Switching Voices

Edit `DEFAULT_VOICE` in `server.py` and restart:

```bash
# In server.py, change:
DEFAULT_VOICE = "galadriel"  # ← your preferred voice

# Restart:
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-voice.tts-server.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-voice.tts-server.plist
```

Or request a specific voice per-request:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:7860/synthesize?text=Hello&voice=samantha" -o hello.wav
```

**`/voice`** handles input: you speak, Claude hears text.
**This project** handles output: Claude responds, you hear speech.

## How It Works

### Voice Cloning (Zero-Shot)

No training or fine-tuning. [Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS) Base extracts a speaker embedding from a 15-second reference clip and generates new speech in that voice. The model runs on [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) — Apple's ML framework that fits the 0.6B model in 6 GB of unified memory.

### The Server

FastAPI + Uvicorn serving WAV audio over HTTP. The model loads once at startup; each voice is a reference WAV + transcript string. All synthesis serialised via a threading lock (MLX Metal crashes on concurrent GPU access).

```
GET /health
  → {"status":"ok", "ready":true, "voices":["galadriel","samantha",...]}

GET /synthesize?text=Hello&voice=galadriel
  → audio/wav (16-bit PCM)
  → 400 if voice unknown (returns available voices)
  → 503 if warming up
```

### The Hook

Claude Code's [Stop hook](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) fires after every response. The hook extracts the response text, strips markdown, queues it for synthesis, and plays the result through your speakers. A background worker with `mkdir`-based locking (macOS has no `flock`) prevents overlapping audio.

### The Queue

Fast Claude conversations generate responses faster than TTS can synthesise. The worker processes a queue (max 10 entries), trimming oldest entries when it overflows. Each response is also archived as MP3 in `~/.claude/tts-archive/`.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4), 8 GB+ RAM
- Python 3.11+
- Claude Code with a Claude.ai account (for `/voice` input)
- ~2 GB disk (model weights + venv)

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| No voice after Claude responds | `curl localhost:7860/health` — if dead: `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-voice.tts-server.plist` |
| "warming up" 503 | Wait ~30s after restart for model load + warmup |
| Voice sounds wrong/garbled | Re-clone with a better reference clip; verify transcript accuracy |
| 40+ seconds per request | Restart the server (model may be reloading per-request) |
| `/voice` not working | Enable with `/voice` command in Claude Code; requires Claude.ai account |
| Hook not firing | Open `/hooks` in Claude Code to verify; or restart session |

## Performance

On 8 GB M1 MacBook Air:
- Model load: ~5s (cached) / ~5 min (first run, downloading 1.5 GB)
- Warmup synthesis: ~15s
- Per request: ~15s fixed overhead + ~0.5x real-time (~20s for a 2-sentence response)
- Peak memory: ~6 GB
- Adding voices: zero extra memory (each is just a 700 KB WAV)
